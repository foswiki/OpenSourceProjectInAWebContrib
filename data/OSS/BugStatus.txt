---++ Bug Status
There are only few status fields in the %PROJECTNAME% bug reports to keep things simple.

| *Name* | *Type* | *Tooltip message* |
| New | option | New bugs, bugs not yet resolved are in this state. |
| Assigned | option | Bug resolution has been assigned to a specific developer. |
| Resolved | option | Bugs that are resolved but not yet implemented in a released version. |
| Released | option | Bug is resolved and fix is implemented in a released version of the program. |
| Duplicate | option | Duplicate of already reported bug. |
| Monitored | option | Bugs that cannot be reproduced or may turn out not to be bugs later. |
| Rejected | option | Rejected. The most controversal state and should always be justified to respect the users. Bugs can be rejected because:<br>- Behavour is as designed and not regarded as a bug.<br>- Feature request - not a bug.<br>- The bug cannot be reproduced by anyone and has been in monitor state for a long time.<br>- Bug is related to using old version of the program or old version of shared libraries or non-compatible hardware and we will not implement the compatibility |
