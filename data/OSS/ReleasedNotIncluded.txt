---++ Released but Not Included
Patch has been released but it is not included in any %PROJECTNAME% version and there is no plan for it.

The reason for this can be.
   * Patch is too special to be part of %PROJECTNAME%
   * Patch is not of a quality to be included in %PROJECTNAME%
   * Patch function has been implemented in another feature which has been evaluated to be better.
   * Most often the reason is that the patch has not yet been evaluated.
